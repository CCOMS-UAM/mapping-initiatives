Moreover, a new definition of 'old age' based on many characteristics rather than just the classical chronological definition of age will be used for calculating projections in each specific population and guide policy recommendations. To do so, the Consortium will create a harmonised dataset with over 400,000 individuals collated from existing longitudinal studies of ageing and including information on physical and mental health, biomarkers, life style habits, social environment and participation, among others.</p>

Models and tools will be developed to allow identification of the individual risk of breast cancer, the subtype of cancer that is most likely to develop and the prognosis of that particular subtype. 
The specific project objectives are: 
* To define the influence of risk factors, including reproductive history, lifestyle, mammographic breast density and germline genetic variation, on breast cancer overall and by subtypes characterized by clinical and molecular markers.
* To define the influence of risk factors and tumour subtypes on clinical prognosis.
* To develop and validate breast cancer risk and prognostication models for breast cancer, overall and by subtypes, informed by knowledge acquired under above objectives
* To implement these models into online tools for risk prediction and prognostication; and make them available in multiple countries/languages.
* To raise awareness, i.e. promote the development and integration of personalized breast cancer prevention within national public health programmes..

helix,The Human Early-Life Exposome,HELIX,"The HELIX project is funded to exploit novel tools and methods for characterisation of early-life exposure to a wide range of environmental hazards. These require integration and linkage with data on major child health outcomes, to develop an “Early-Life Exposome” approach.

Six prospective birth cohort studies (INMA-Spain, RHEA-Greece, MoBa-Norway, EDEN-France, BiB-UK, KANC-Lithuania) are contributing to HELIX as the only realistic and feasible way to obtain the comprehensive, longitudinal, human data needed to build this early-life exposome. These cohorts have already collected large amounts of data as part of national and EU-funded projects. Results will be integrated with data from European cohorts (>300,000 subjects) and registers, to estimate health impacts at the large European scale. This integration of the chemical, physical and molecular environment during critical early-life periods will lead to major improvements in health risk and impact assessments and thus to improved prevention strategies for vulnerable populations.
