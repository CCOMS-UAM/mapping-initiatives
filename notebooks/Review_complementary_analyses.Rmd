# Topics by funding

Comment by reviewer 2:

> What type of data/ area of research was funded by private institutions
vs public ones? Were they different?

# NÂº of cohorts (total & harmonized), participants (total & harmonized), and harmonized variables for initiatives with/without omics data

Comment by reviewer 2:

> I suspect that the cohorts with a large number of variables (ex 37k)
and large N must be cohorts related to cohorts with biological data (omics).

```{r}
tab1_new                |>
  filter(!is.na(omics)) |>
  select(
    omics,
    starts_with(c("cohorts.", "participants.", "harmonizedvariables"))
  )                     |>
  tbl_summary(
    by = omics,
    type = everything() ~ "continuous"
  )
```

<br>

We suspect the teams carrying out the initiatives _with omics data_ may still
be active.
To investigate this, we look at the frequency of this variable for intiatives
with/without omics data.

```{r}
tab1_new                |>
  filter(!is.na(omics)) |>
  tbl_summary(by = omics, include = team_activity)
```
